# Technical TA

### Technical Content

On completion of the “Intro to Coding” course students should have learnt:

* General digital skills such as how to search and how to find useful resources.
* How to build a website from scratch by using the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, including:
  * HTML Basics: introduction, document structure, formatting, lines & comments, elements, attributes, images, links, lists,  tables, forms and input, frames.
  * HTML5: content models, page structure, header, nav & footer, audio and video elements, animation and canvas.
  * CSS Basics: text, properties, positioning and layout, CSS3, gradients and backgrounds, transitioning & transforms, CSS filte

### What have they been working on?

The content in “Intro to Coding” is a steps based process. Students are first invited to do three tutorials (HTML, CSS, JS) on the app Sololearn, this is optional but encouraged for students who are completely new to coding. The students must then complete tutorials on FreeCodeCamp on HTML, CSS, and JS basics. Once completed students move on to building a tribute page and a landing page using FreeCodeCamp.&#x20;

The coursework appears to students like this:

### Post-Course Content (to be updated)

After completion of the course we provide the students with a resource pack which includes

* Where to go to find more learning resources
* Schemes in their city where they can get more help
* Our recommendations for further learning

## Running a class

The technical content of the class comes in two blocks. These sessions are designed to give the students the opportunity to work through problems, ask questions and help each other. Following an introduction to the session by the lead instructor the class will split into break-out groups with a TA per group (the groups will be divided depending on how far students have progressed with the course). The TAs should encourage students to discuss the challenges they’ve come across, share solutions with each other and work together . The TA can offer guidance and advice when needed but should always try to encourage students to solve questions first.&#x20;

N.B. Screen Sharing is a powerful tool. Encourage your students to share their screen to illustrate a challenge and share your screen when demonstrating a concept.&#x20;

### **Breakout rooms**

Whilst in breakout rooms TAs will be responsible for supporting a small group of students who should have reached a similar step in the course (If a student is at a different step to the group then the zoom admin should be alerted so that the student can be reassigned to a more appropriate room). The rooms will be divided as follows:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="New Starters" %}
Students who have registered and not progressed on the course content and need support getting started.&#x20;

New students who have not signed up need volunteers to help them with the registration process.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sololearn" %}
Students who have been working on Sololearn (HTML, CSS & JS), this group may be split further depending on number of students & how far students have progressed within Sololearn.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="FreeCodeCamp" %}
Students who have begun working on the FreeCodeCamp content. This group may be split further between those who are working on the tutorials and those who are working on their tribute/landing pages.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

More resources are being made available in the following pages for Tech TAs depending on which group they are running. For any further questions, please ask the Lead Instructor as seen on the schedule.
