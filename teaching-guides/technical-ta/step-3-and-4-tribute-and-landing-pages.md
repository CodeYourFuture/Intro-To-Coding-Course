# Step 3 & 4 - Tribute and Landing pages

The next step for students is to follow these instructions to build a tribute page [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page) 

These students have completed all of the tutorials up until this point and have started working with more freedom and range. This is a great opportunity to encourage students to be curious and challenge themselves.

* Students should be in a position to work out the solutions to their challenges with a small amount of encouragement/guidance. Work with the group to collectively answer questions etc. 
* We value improvements. When students have 'completed' their pages ask how they could improve them and work with them to achieve this

The Landing page should be made using this documentation

[https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page)

![These are the guidelines for feedback on the landing page](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

Encourage students to use the screen share to demonstrate their progress and work together as a group to spot mistakes and suggest improvements.
