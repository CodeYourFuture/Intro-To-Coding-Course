# Step 3 & 4 - Tribute and Landing pages

The next step for students is to follow these instructions to build a tribute page [https://learn.freecodecamp.org/../build-a-tribute-page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/../build-a-tribute-page) 

These students have completed all of the tutorials up until this point and have started working with more freedom and range. This is a great opportunity to encourage students to be curious and challenge themselves. 

* Students should be in a position to work out the solutions to their challenges with a small amount of encouragement/guidance. Work with the group to collectively answer questions etc. 
* We value improvements. When students have 'completed' their pages ask how they could improve them and work with them to achieve this

The Landing page should be made using this documentation

Encourage students to use the screen share to demonstrate their progress and work together as a group to spot mistakes and suggest improvements.
