# Minimal Manual: Typing faster

## Why should I read this?

Nearly all programming involves typing on a keyboard, so it's important to become efficient with how you type.

You already know the basics of typing, but there are some tricks you might not have seen before. This guide contains some tips that help you improve your typing.

## Typing capital letters faster

You may know that you can type a capital letter (for example: A, B, C) by turning on the Caps Lock key, pressing the letter key, then turning off the Caps Lock key again.

There is a faster way of typing capital letters:

- Open an application where you can type some text
  - Some examples: Google Docs, Word, VS Code
- Press the Shift key and the T key at the same time

*You should have typed a capital T.*

- Press the H key

*You should have typed lower case h.*

* Finish the sentence "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog"

Make sure you use the Shift key to insert capital letters.

## Copy and paste

You may have copied or pasted text by right-clicking, then clicking the Copy or Paste buttons:

There are keyboard shortcuts to make copying and pasting faster:

- Use your mouse to select the text below by clicking and dragging
  - Hello Code Your Future!
- Now press two keys at once:
  - If you are on a Windows or Linux computer, press the Ctrl key and the C key
  - If you are on a Mac, press the Command key and the C key

*You have now copied the text. (Note: there's nothing to tell you this!)*

- Open your text document again
- Now press two keys at once to paste the text:
  - If you on a Windows or Linux computer, press the Ctrl key and the V key
  - If you are on a Mac, press the Command key and the V key

*You should now see that "Hello Code Your Future" was pasted into your document.*

- If nothing was pasted, you may have not copied the text correctly. Try doing the section about copying again.

## Selecting text

In the previous chapter, you selected some text using your mouse. There is also a way of selecting text using the keyboard, which can be faster:

- In your text document, make sure your cursor is at the end of the line with Hello Code Your Future
- Hold the Shift key down and press the Left Arrow key

*The letter e at the end of the line will be selected*
