# Preparation

Once you've signed up to help with a session please make sure you've done the following before the class:

* Read over the Agenda and the brief for your role
* Read over any additional material listed below for your specific role
* Ask any questions in the \#introtocoding-workshop channel or ask @Barnaby Dathan or email me at barnaby@codeyourfuture.io

**Frequently Asked Questions from Students**

During these sessions you'll receive lots of questions about all things CodeYourFuture - Don't Panic! ... If you don't know the answer to a question you have a few options:

* Ask another volunteer on the call or via Slack
* Direct the student to one of the following resources: 
  * FAQ at bottom of study page: [https://codeyourfuture.io/become-a-student/](https://codeyourfuture.io/become-a-student/)
  * FAQ on student dashboard page: [https://course1.codeyourfuture.io/dashboard](https://course1.codeyourfuture.io/dashboard)
* Direct students to Slack as a great place to ask questions to the CYF community
* If these don't solve the issue take down the name and contact details of the student along with their question and pass it on to your coordinator \(or Barnaby^\) and let the student know that we will follow up with them.
