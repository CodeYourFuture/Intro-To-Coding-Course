# Preparation

Once you've signed up to help with a session please make sure you've done the following before the class:

* Read over the Agenda and the brief for your role
* Read over any additional material listed below for your specific role
* Ask any questions in the #intro-to-digital-workshop channel or ask your coordinator

**Frequently Asked Questions from Students**

During these sessions you'll receive lots of questions about all things CodeYourFuture - Don't Panic! ... If you don't know the answer to a question you have a few options:

* Ask another volunteer on the call or via Slack
* Direct the applicant to one of the following resources:&#x20;
  * FAQ at bottom of study page: [https://codeyourfuture.io/become-a-student/](https://codeyourfuture.io/become-a-student/)
  * FAQ on trainee dashboard page: [https://course1.codeyourfuture.io/dashboard](https://course1.codeyourfuture.io/dashboard)
* Direct applicants to Slack as a great place to ask questions to the CYF community
* If these don't solve the issue take down the name and contact details of the applicant along with their question and pass it on to your coordinator and let the applicant know that we will follow up with them.&#x20;
