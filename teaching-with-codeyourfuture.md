### **Teaching values and Guideline**

At CodeYourFuture we believe in empowering our students by providing them with the support and guidance they need to excel. We work to achieve this by encouraging students to work together as teams and to practice problem solving together to overcome challenges. This builds the fundamental skills needed to learn and succeed on any of the CodeYourFuture courses and on into a professional career. Some principles should be applied when supporting students on the “intro to coding” course:

* Be positive; build on students’ successes.
* Be patient and understanding; students on this course come from a variety of backgrounds and it may take some longer than others to accomplish tasks.
* Encourage self-learning and teamwork; students should be encouraged to work together to solve problems, these skills are vital for long-term success.
* Praise and support; the main objective of the intro to coding course is to build the confidence of students and show them that they are capable of learning these skills.&#x20;
* Encourage everybody to talk, leaving questions open to answer will lead to only a few participants dominating the conversation. Try to encourage everybody to participate by inviting individuals to answer direct questions.
