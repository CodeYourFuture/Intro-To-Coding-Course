# Running The Workshop

## **Sessions**

### **Volunteers join **

Volunteers join call, ensuring that they are properly set up for the session (cameras on, microphones working, made co-hosts & names labelled as TAs). Volunteers have an opportunity to meet each other and go over the plan for the workshop.&#x20;

### **Technical Set up (10 mins)**

Students join and are supported by volunteers to ensure that they are set up correctly to participate in the workshop. Zoom admin can offer advice on technical issues. Volunteers can also encourage discussion whilst technical issues are fixed.

* Put people who need more technical assistance in a separate room with a volunteer to get 1 to 1 support
* Ask everybody to introduce themselves as a way of checking all microphones work.

### ** Ice breakers (15 mins)**

Ice breakers are essential in remote workshops as they break tension and make students and volunteers more comfortable when working with unknown peers. A good icebreaker should encourage all participants to talk and share with each other, it should be fun and engaging. They are a useful way to get participants talking and should be quick and not require a lot of thinking when people are put on the spot.

* Please note Icebreakers should not be camera dependant

### **Motivational Speaker (10 mins)**

The motivational speaker is a CYF graduate or current student. In this session the speaker shares their journey and experience with CYF. The presentation should last approx. 8-10 minutes with 5 minutes for questions from students.

### **Technical session (35 mins)**

The Technical session is an opportunity for students to breakout into smaller groups and work together to cover the content of the Intro to Coding workshop. Each breakout group should have a volunteer present who can offer guidance, knowledge and support throughout the session but they should only steer the conversation and should aim for students to lead most of the discussion.&#x20;

Students should be split into groups depending on how far they have progressed on the course. Depending on numbers these groups should be roughly:&#x20;

| Progress in Course                 | Breakout Room Name |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Newcomers/No Progress              | New                |
| Completed 1+ Sololearn Tutorials   | SL                 |
| Has started FreeCodeCamp Tutorials | FCC 1              |
| Has completed all FCC tutorials    | FCC 2              |

The 'new' students will be given an introduction to CodeYourFuture and then work with a Tech TA through the first Sololearn tutorials. The Sololearn group should work together to complete further Sololearn tutorials. FFC 1 and FCC 2 may be one or two groups depending on student and volunteer numbers and should collectively work through the FCC stages of the course.&#x20;

### **Break (10 mins)**

An opportunity to step away from the computer. If you do then attendees should turn off mics and cameras but stay in the call. Bring everyone back to the main room to a closing summary before the last technical session as the call is left open. This is also an opportunity for any students to move rooms.

### **Technical session 2 (40mins +)**

Similar to the first session this is an opportunity for students to work together with the support of volunteers. The call is left open for students to stay and work together or chat once volunteers have left. This is most successful when the students have been encouraged to work together to tackle the course content. \
